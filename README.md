# Hello, plz read

This code was my first ever attempt at c++ and arduino so it's pretty ugly.

The arduino code is in the master directory and there is a basic explination of how to wire it in the .fzz or png files in root.

If you have questions and i have tiem to answer, then email me: richardelms [at] gmail dot com.

Good luck.
